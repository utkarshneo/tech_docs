# GitHub Insights Plugin

**Description:** The plugin will showcase a new tab with the following insights about the GitHub repository catalog in RearPortal:

- Contributor List

- Code Language Distribution

- The root Readme

- Release List (optional)

**Business Value:** The notion of surfacing relevant metadata in the single pane of glass is exemplied here.

We can see some useful insights without searching for the repository in GitHub.
